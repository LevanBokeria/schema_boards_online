We hypothesize that people can use their knowledge of the location of these 6 pictures as "landmarks" or "anchors" in learning the locations of the 2nd set of 6 picutres in block 3. On other boards, sometimes the 1st set of 6 pictures either swapped locations with each other from block 1 to block 2, or moved randomly to a new location on the board.</p>' +
